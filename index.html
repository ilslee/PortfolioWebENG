                Benzamin is an AI mattress designed to improve sleep quality.
                It tracks the user's sleep in real time and delivers vibration feedback to enhance recovery during sleep.
                Additionally, it provides sleep coaching services based on accumulated sleep data to improve sleep quality. </p>

                To emphasize its identity as a sleep improvement device and showcase the pioneering spirit of a new player, 
                I aimed for a design that stands apart from traditional mattresses as furniture. 
                the mattress designed to seamlessly integrate functional elements requiring explanation, 
                highlighting them without making them feel out of place.

                Benzamin's main devices and sensors are embedded within the mattress. 
                To ensure device stability and comfortable usability, we utilized four specially designed foam layers. 
                A unique structure was designed to allow the sensors to measure bio-data from within the mattress.

                A number of partner companies participated in the development and production of the mattress.
                As the product designer and production manager, I gathered input from experts in various fields and 
                coordinated to align with the intended purpose of the design.
                Throughout this process, I utilized various visual materials to prevent misunderstandings during production and 
                to effectively exchange necessary information.
