        I am a designer with 9 years of experience. I am highly curious and proactive in learning new things. 
        Building on this nature, I have achieved results in various design fields, 
        and my greatest strength lies in synthesizing accumulated knowledge and experience to generate new ideas and bring them to life. <br>
        Currently, I am leading the product development team at BRLab, 
        focusing on the design and development of AI mattresses and medical devices. 
        In addition, my skills extend to UI/UX design, character design, branding, illustration, Media design, graphic design, 
        and game development. These diverse skills have provided a foundation for effective communication with both internal and external teams, 
        resulting in exceptional work outcomes. <br>
        I enjoy creating integrated deliverables based on my broad experience, 
        and I am now looking for opportunities to go beyond being a design expert and take on roles in planning and project leadership. 
        I aspire to contribute to enhancing customer satisfaction through creative and innovative designs that reflect the latest trends.
