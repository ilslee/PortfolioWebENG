                This is a game based on the childhood games I often played with friends. 
                After undergoing significant refactoring following the first demo, 
                I’ve come to realize firsthand that a solid plan is essential for the success of a project. 
                As the work progresses, I’ve also learned the importance of designing programs that are easy to develop and 
                continue to reflect on how to achieve efficient project management.

                allowing them to experience the product's features through gameplay. 
                Since mattress demonstrations tend to require long durations and may result in less promotional impact, 
                the focus was placed on increasing audience engagement and highlighting the expanded usability of the product.

                Before evolving into Benzamin, the brand was known as Zable. 
                Zable underwent an exterior update, during which I designed the logo type and icon for Zable 2.0. 
                These designs incorporated the refined concepts that emerged during product development, 
                creating a symbol that satisfies both the conceptual and emotional aspects of its core functionality.

                a solid jewel-like shape was adopted. Additionally, to align with the keyword "AI data analysis via the cloud," 
                the design intentionally incorporated a sense of "connection."
